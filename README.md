# Trello to Projects

This is a quick and dirty script to migrate from Trello to Github Projects (under an organization)

To use, rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your appropriate keys

Then run `node index.js`. This requires about [node 7ish](http://node.green)? Otherwise use babel-node.
